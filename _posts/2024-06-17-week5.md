## Week 5 Post (6/17 - 6/23)
---

In the fifth week of my DREU Research Program, I dedicated the entire week to working on the autograder assigned to me last week. This task has been particularly time-consuming because it involves grading a gaming assignment. The nature of this assignment is quite open-ended, as we provide general basic guidelines, and students are free to create any game they like based on those guidelines. This makes grading such assignments challenging. However, the professors have been incredibly helpful and are always available to assist whenever I encounter any blockers.

We also fixed some bugs in our previously submitted autograders this week. The autograder will be complete once the faculty code review is done. Since the UR2PhD course has ended, we are primarily focusing on developing as many autograders as possible. I concentrated on identifying buggy student solutions and creating initial testers for my autograder, and I hope to continue making substantial progress in the upcoming weeks.
