## Week 1 Post (5/20 - 5/24)
---

This was the first week of my DREU Research Program. I spent the first day getting acquainted with the Professors I would be working with. We were also informed about our responsiblity in contributing to the project - we will be working on developing and testing autograders for different assignments for Duke University's courses on Coursera. Moreover, we will be learning how to read research papers.

I also spent time with my research team on developing the autograder for the first assignment we were assigned. We started with first understanding how Pytest works, and also how the autograder code works. We started with the development of our code and worked on debugging to resolve the errors we faced.

During this week, I also attended UR2PhD's online courses which focused on what research is, and how we can collaborate with others. I also worked on completing their assignments. I believe this course aligns well with my current timeline of the tasks assigned as part of the research I am working on.

Overall, the first week involved getting comfortable with my responsibilities as part of a team and getting started with developing autograders.
