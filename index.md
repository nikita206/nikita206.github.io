## About My Project

We are trying to build an online Python programming  course that is culturally relevant with assignments that are open-ended yet autograded. That is, to first create an opened assignment, and then rework it so it can be autograded. I will learn how to write autograders and also develop assignments that are attractive to a wide audience.
