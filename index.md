## About Me

Hi! My name is Nikita Agarwal and I am a current student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am a rising senior pursuing Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I will be graduating in May 2025 and intend to work as a Software Engineer afterwards.

My Email address is nikitaag206@gmail.com - feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Professor Susan Rodger who is a Professor of the Practice in the Computer Science Department at Duke University. Her research is in visualization, algorithm animation, and computer science education. She developed JFLAP, software for experimenting with formal languages and automata that is used in automata theory courses worldwide. She also leads the Adventures in Alice Programming project to integrate computing into K-12. Moreover, with others, she has created several online introductory programming Coursera courses.

## About My Project

We are trying to build an online Python programming  course that is culturally relevant with assignments that are open-ended yet autograded. That is, to first create an opened assignment, and then rework it so it can be autograded. I will learn how to write autograders and also develop assignments that are attractive to a wide audience.
